# Bubble Sort: The Video Game
## Concept:
The point of this game is to point out how useless we are.

More specifically, I want to make a React.JS web game that allows the player to sort a randomly generated list of ten numbers. The player should only be able to see two numbers at a time, and use buttons to shift their view up and down the array. This should be timed so the player can play again and again to improve their time.

In Player Vs Computer mode, the player should be able to enter their name and try to beat the computer in sorting a list. Of course, the computer should sort the list in seconds, though the sorting should still be displayed graphically as if the computer has to sort their list just as the player does. There should be a slide show of text after both players have finished.

There should also be a help screen detailing how the game works.
